**Summary.** This issue gives two explicit 58-point subsets of the 32 x 32 grid containing no isosceles triangle, including degenerate ones. Both pass this repository's unchanged verifier and independent exact-integer checks, establishing C(32) >= 58 for problem 59 (Problem 6.59 in the paper). This exceeds the value 56 stated in PatternBoost and repeated in the AlphaEvolve paper. Could you clarify the scope of the earlier optimality claim, and whether this improvement is already known?

**The earlier statements.** PatternBoost (arXiv:2411.00566, section 4.1) captions its Figure 12(e) "f(32) = 56" and says that "for n up to ≈ 32, SAT solvers can find the best constructions and prove their optimality". The AlphaEvolve paper (arXiv:2511.02864, section 6.39) refers to "the fact that C(16) = 28 and C(32) = 56". Both use the definition checked here: a, b, c distinct implies d(a, b) != d(b, c). This is a lower bound only: I make no claim that 58 is optimal, and no claim of priority beyond the sources I could find on 2026-10-04 (the two papers, this repository and its issues).

**The sets**, as 0-based (x, y) tuples in {0, ..., 31}^2, ready to paste into the notebook:

```python
set_a = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 26), (0, 27), (1, 2), (1, 29), (3, 0), (3, 11), (3, 20), (3, 31), (6, 0), (6, 11),
    (6, 20), (6, 31), (7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 20), (7, 31), (8, 1), (8, 30), (9, 1), (9, 30), (11, 4), (11, 5),
    (11, 8), (11, 23), (11, 26), (11, 27), (12, 1), (12, 30), (19, 1), (19, 30), (20, 4), (20, 5), (20, 8),
    (20, 23), (20, 26), (20, 27), (22, 1), (22, 30), (23, 1), (23, 30), (24, 0), (24, 11), (24, 20), (24,
    31), (25, 0), (25, 11), (25, 20), (25, 31), (28, 0), (28, 11), (28, 20), (28, 31), (31, 4), (31, 5),
    (31, 26), (31, 27)
]

set_b = [
    (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 24), (0, 25), (0, 28), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 12), (1, 19), (1, 22), (1, 23),
    (4, 0), (4, 11), (4, 20), (4, 31), (5, 0), (5, 11), (5, 20), (5, 31), (8, 11), (8, 20), (11, 3), (11,
    6), (11, 7), (11, 24), (11, 25), (11, 28), (20, 3), (20, 6), (20, 7), (20, 24), (20, 25), (20, 28), (23,
    11), (23, 20), (26, 0), (26, 11), (26, 20), (26, 31), (27, 0), (27, 11), (27, 20), (27, 31), (29, 1),
    (29, 30), (30, 8), (30, 9), (30, 12), (30, 19), (30, 22), (30, 23), (31, 3), (31, 6), (31, 7), (31, 24),
    (31, 25), (31, 28)
]
```

They share no point, and neither is an image of the other under the eight symmetries of the square. Each is symmetric under the reflection y -> 31 - y, and each is maximal: no further grid point can be added. As in the published constructions, most points lie near the border.

**Verification.** Each set passes four exact-integer checks:

- `verify_construction` from `experiments/subsets_of_the_grid_with_no_isosceles_triangles/subsets_of_the_grid_with_no_isosceles_triangles.ipynb`, run unchanged: True for both. As controls, it returns True for the notebook's own `sol_64` (112 points) and False for set_a with the midpoint of two of its points added.
- A brute-force pass over every unordered triple, requiring the three squared distances to be pairwise different.
- [`problems/noisosceles/evaluate.py`](https://github.com/hashkanna/mendel-evolve/blob/c012959dcd6427e21fd79ddb65e8493454526556/problems/noisosceles/evaluate.py): for each apex, sorted squared distances to all other points with no repeat.
- [`problems/noisosceles/verify.py`](https://github.com/hashkanna/mendel-evolve/blob/c012959dcd6427e21fd79ddb65e8493454526556/problems/noisosceles/verify.py): a perpendicular-bisector test that uses no distances.

Certificates with the seed and solver configuration of each run are in [`results/noisosceles/certificates/`](https://github.com/hashkanna/mendel-evolve/tree/c012959dcd6427e21fd79ddb65e8493454526556/results/noisosceles/certificates) (`n32_58.json` and `n32_58_seed13_iters600000.json`; the second is from a deterministic run and can be regenerated).

**Agreement with the other published values.** The same solver and checkers agree with the published values everywhere else we looked, and do not exceed them:

| n | published | this search |
|---:|---:|---|
| 4 to 10 | 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18 | the same seven values, by a complete exhaustive search ([`exact_small.py`](https://github.com/hashkanna/mendel-evolve/blob/c012959dcd6427e21fd79ddb65e8493454526556/results/noisosceles/exact_small.py)) |
| 16 | 28 | 28 in 200 of 200 runs |
| 27 | 48 | 48 in 200 of 200 runs |
| 32 | 56 | **58** in 15 of 200 runs, 56 in the other 185 |
| 64 | 112 (AlphaEvolve) | 112, not exceeded |
| 100 | 164 (AlphaEvolve) | 164, not exceeded |

The agreement at n = 4 to 10 is a sanity check that the definition used here is the published one. The n = 16, 27 and 32 rows are 200 seeded runs of 60 CPU-seconds each.

**How they were found, and disclosure.** These came out of a hackathon project, MendelEvolve (London AI x Science Hackathon, 3 to 4 October 2026). The search is a local search in C with a mirror-symmetry constraint, written from scratch by an AI coding agent (Claude) under my direction; the checkers and this post were AI-assisted as well. No search code from other contributors was used. I take responsibility for the claim; it rests on the coordinates above and the verifier in this repository, not on trust in model output.

Corrections welcome. If the optimality at n = 32 was established for a different definition, or a set of 58 or more points is already public, I will amend this.
